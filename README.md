# Speak-able
HackCamp 2021 Project

## Description ##
The main idea of this project is **inclusive unconferencing**. An unconference is a participant-driven event where anyone can speak, but that's not easy for everyone. Speak-able allows less confident participants to safely gauge interest in a potential topic before scheduling a talk. This increases confidence that people want to hear them and allows them to participate more fully in the event. Everyone benefits when introverts, new speakers and anyone usure they fit in are encouraged to present their ideas.

## How it Works ## 
Speak-able is a website that allows someone create a room for an unconference or join an existing one using a unique code. It also allows people to submit a topic for other unconference participants to vote on. This allows the potential speaker to gauge interest in their topic and feel confident that people want to hear them speak. 

## Other information ##
The design was created in Figma, then re-created with HTML/CSS, and Javascript. The back-end is node, express, and Javascript. See the [DevPost posting](https://devpost.com/software/speak-able-inclusive-unconferencing) for more details and a demo about this project.
